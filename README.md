# Video-Club-Application
Implemented a video club application. From the available menu, the user can choose to rent DVDs, Blue Rays and games, he can see the details of the item and rent it. Also, he can see his rented items, choose to return an item and pay the cost. The available items and their info are read from ItemList.txt, which is the Video Clubâ€™s database and the rentals are written to myRents.txt.
**Worked with: Java, Eclipse Studio.**
